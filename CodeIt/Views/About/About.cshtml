            to use app like a storege for useful solutions. Here you can edit and delete your own posts and comment the pastes of other users. Also
            if you dont want to use profile options you can just paste code like a guest user and for example, copy the link and send it or poste it anywhere else.
            The guest paste can also can be commented.
